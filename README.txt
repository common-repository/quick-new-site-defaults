Set default settings of a freshly installed site quickly.

== Description ==

Set default settings of a freshly installed site quickly.

The plugin saves your time with default settings on a single options page. After you have installed a new WordPress site activate that plugin and choose a few settings. The plugin sets typical settings either for a blog site or a static site. Save them with one single click and the configuration of the new site is done! The plugin does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.
